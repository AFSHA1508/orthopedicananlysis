# orthopedicanalysis
• The Project Orthopedic Patients analysis is a machine learning model. The Prediction Model has been made by using following algorithms:
1.	Decision tree
2.	K-Nearest Neighbor
3.	Logistic Regression
4.	Random Forest 
5.	Support Vector Machine.    

•	The Project is been made by using open source libraries such as 
1.	pandas
2.	numpy
3.	matplotlib
4.	seaborn
5.	pickle
6.	sklearn

•	The main aim of my project is to provide a platform to users from where they can use my machine learning model in order to predict that the patients is normal or abnormal.

•	The mission is so simple and straight forward to contribute into the field of medical by building a machine learning model and deploying it later so that it can be available for public use.

•	The outcome of project is very important when it comes to personal health and project is made up with no funds it is free for everyone who wants to do good towards orthopedic patients.
